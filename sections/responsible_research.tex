To prevent test set contamination, we pre-trained our models on datasets that were separate from those used for evaluation. This addresses an issue highlighted in recent works, where pre-training on test sets can artificially inflate performance metrics and call into question the validity of the results \cite{schaeffer2023pretraining}. Ensuring distinct separation between training and evaluation datasets maintains the integrity of our findings and contributes to the reliability of our research.

In conducting this research, we ensured transparency and reproducibility by sharing the experimental setup under section \ref{sec:experimental_setup}. The datasets and models used are publicly available and can be found in the references. Furthermore, all the implemented code is available on GitHub? We adhered to scientific integrity by fabrication, and plagiarism, ensuring that everything was reported accurately with proper citations.

Guided by the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, we incorporated principles of honesty, transparency, and responsibility, ensuring our research practices align with the highest standards. We followed the educational and normative framework from chapters 2 and 3 of the Code, emphasizing good research practices that promote a responsible research environment \cite{knaw2018integrity}.
