Questions
- Should the existing activation funcitons be explained in background or in the experiment section? I actually kind of like it in approach, because I also motivate why I chose the ones i choose there?
- should models and dataset and babylm be exaplained in the background research or experiment section. also, whats the reason we went with roBERRTa and NEO, not other models?
- what citations do i need for activation functions? can i just say i get them from pytorch
- check the kan section for efficient kan repo 

Smaller questions
